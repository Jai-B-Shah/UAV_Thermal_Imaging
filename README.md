Developed a UAV-based thermal imaging system that integrates advanced aerial data acquisition with intelligent image analysis to enable reliable monitoring of pipelines. The system captures high-resolution thermal images using a UAV platform, allowing for efficient coverage of large and inaccessible areas. These thermal images are processed using a CNN, which learns and extracts relevant spatial and thermal patterns associated with pipeline deformations. To achieve accurate and real-time identification, YOLOv8 is employed for automated detection, enabling the system to locate and classify deformation regions directly from the thermal imagery with high precision and speed. In addition to detection, the system performs automatic geotagging, associating each detected deformation with its exact geographic coordinates, and timestamping, ensuring that every detection is recorded with the corresponding date and time. This integrated approach provides a structured and traceable record of pipeline deformation events, improving inspection efficiency and supporting timely maintenance and decision-making.
